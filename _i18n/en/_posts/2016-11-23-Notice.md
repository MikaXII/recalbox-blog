## Introduction
The recalbox is a system that will allow you to play retro games easily.

It runs on a micro computer called the Raspberry Pi, and uses a batch of optimized emulators.

## <a name='first-use'></a>I - First use
The necessary package :
- A raspberry PI 1, 2 or 3
- 16GB or more SD/microSD card
- HDMI cable
- a micro USB power cable **> 1.5AMP**
- a USB or a Bluetooth* controller (*_and Bluetooth>USB dongle_)

See **[recalbox.com/diy](http://www.recalbox.com/diyrecalbox)** for more information on the first install.

After the [[Installation|Installation-(EN)]], the first thing you have to do is to connect the recalbox to the TV with the HDMI cable.

To power on the recalbox, just plug the micro USB power cable in.

Many controllers work out of the box, but if you want to configure directly an USB controller, plug in a USB keyboard and see [Add an usb controller](#configurecontrollers)

To shut down the system : push on the start button and choose “QUIT” and “SHUTDOWN SYSTEM”. _(Shortcut: Press "Select" for shut down only menu)_  

You can then unplug the power cable. _(Best Practice: wait for green/orange light on PI to stop flashing)_

## <a name='configuration'></a>II - Configuration

### <a name='controllers'></a>A - Controllers
Wired and wireless _PS3 Dualshock_ and _Xbox 360_ controllers are supported. Many **USB** and **Bluetooth** controllers are supported too. For more information see the [peripheral compatibility list](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/Compatibility-%28EN%29) 

**Note:** By default the PS3 controller is selected in the config. If you are using other controllers it may be necessary to de-select the PS3 controller, select the controller you are using, save the config & reboot. Find your controller below for more specifics. 

#### <a name='ps3controllers'></a>1 - PS3 controllers
You must have a bluetooth dongle to use a PS3 wireless controller.
You cannot charge the sisaxis on the RPi, you must charge controllers directly on the usb power.  
Plug the controller on the recalbox **only** to associate your controller with your recalbox.  
In order to associate a _PS3 controller_, plug the controller on the recalbox and **wait 10 seconds**. You can now unplug the controller and press the Home button.

For asian copies of the PS3 dualshock 3 (aka GASIA or SHANWAN) see [[PS3 controllers drivers|PS3-controllers-drivers-(EN)]]

Remember that the configuration of the controllers in recalbox is based on the SNES buttons assignment : 

| ps3 pad | snes pad |
| :--------------: | :--------------: |
| x | B |
| ◯ | A |
| ⬜ | Y |
| △ | X |

**Note:** The default **HOTKEY** button is the **PS** button. The one in the middle of your controller. 

For more info about HOTKEY actions like saving/loading see the [Special commands](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Manual-%28EN%29#duringgame-special) section.

#### <a name='xboxcontrollers'></a>2 - XBox 360 controllers

**Note:** XBox 360 Wireless controllers need specific wireless receiver hardware.  

If you have a XBox 360 wired or wireless controller, please activate the `xboxdrv` option in [recalbox.conf](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/recalbox.conf-%28EN%29) to have the best out-of-box-support for your controller. 

The easiest way to adjust the recalbox.conf file is to navigate to the recalbox web frontend via a webbrowser (f.e. http://192.168.1.100) and make the following changes in the configuration tab:

* First de-select the PS3 controller(default) change `controllers.ps3.enabled=1` to `controllers.ps3.enabled=0`
* Then change the xBox settings from `controllers.xboxdrv.enabled=0` to `controllers.xboxdrv.enabled=1`

Then reboot with your controller or wireless receiver plugged in. (It is recommended to "wake up" the controllers before starting the PI")

Remember that the configuration of the controllers in recalbox is based on the SNES buttons assignment : 

| xbox pad | snes pad |
| :--------------: | :--------------: |
| A | B |
| B | A |
| X | Y |
| Y | X |

**Note:** The default **HOTKEY** button is the **HOME** button. The big one in the middle of your controller.

For more info about HOTKEY actions like saving/loading see the [Special commands](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Manual-%28EN%29#duringgame-special) section.

#### <a name='btcontrollers'></a>3 - Add a bluetooth controller
To add a bluetooth controller, set your controller in pairing mode.  
Then go to the menu with start button or a keyboard and select **Controller Settings**. 

Select **Pair a bluetooth Controller**:  
[![](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/bluetooth-pair-350px.jpg)](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/bluetooth-pair.jpg)

A list of detected controllers appears, just select yours and now the controller is paired! Now you can configure it if it's not already a supported controller!

For **8bitdo** users, see [[8bitdo on recalbox|8bitdo-on-recalbox-(EN)]]. 


#### <a name='configurecontrollers'></a>4 - Configure a controller
You can add USB controllers on the recalbox.

Most models are compatible, see the [compatibility list](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/Compatibility-%28EN%29)


After plugging your usb controller or pairing your bluetooth controller, press START with an already configured controller (or ENTER on the keyboard) and select "CONFIGURE INPUTS".

Then follow instructions. 

The last button, the **HOTKEY** is a button that will activate buttons combination (see [Special commands](#duringgame-special)). For xbox 360 and PS3 gamepads, the default hotkey button is **HOME** or **PS**. It is recommended to use **L3** (the joystick click on dualshock) or _**SELECT**_  

Buttons assignment is based on the Super Nintendo controller :  
![](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/snes-controller.jpg)

The L and R buttons (with L2 R2 L3 R3) are based on Playstation controllers.


Pass any buttons you don't have by pressing a button for 2 seconds.


Back on the configuration screen, you can assign the controller to a player. _Your controller is now configured !_


#### <a name='btnmapping'></a>5 - Buttons mapping

For 6 buttons controllers (snes, psx, arcade etc) the buttons are mapped to corresponding buttons on the original controller.   
For 2 buttons controllers (nes, pcengine, gameboy etc) the mapped buttons are B and A.

#### <a name='keyboardmapping'></a>6 - Keyboard mapping
If you totally failed at the controller configuration or just want to configure a controller, you can attach a wired USB keyboard to the recalbox.
Enter is **START**, Space is **SELECT**, S is **BACK**, A is **OK**

#### <a name='gpiocontrollers'></a>7 - GPIO controllers
You can connect your arcade joysticks and buttons directly on the raspberry GPIOs. See [[GPIO controllers|GPIO-controllers-(EN)]]

You can connect original controllers from PSOne, Nes, Snes, Megradrive and other. See [[DB9 and Gamecon controllers|DB9-and-Gamecon-controllers-(EN)]]


#### <a name='virtualgamepads'></a>8 - Virtual Gamepads
With Miroof's [Virtual Gamepads](https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads) you can add up to 4 controllers with your phones ! 
Just start your Internet Navigator on your phone, and type the recalbox IP followed by the communication port (port=8080). You can get the recalbox IP in the setting menu  [NETWORK SETTINGS](#user-content-6---network-settings)

[![](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/virutalgamepad_touch_zones-350px.png)](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/virutalgamepad_touch_zones.png)

For more info see [[Virtual Gamepad|Virtual-Gamepad-(EN)]]

### <a name='system-settings'></a>B - System Settings
You have two ways to configure your recalbox. The frontend Emulationstation offers many configurations features. See [EmulationStation settings](#es-settings)

But if you want to fine tuning emulators one by one, you should have a look at **[[recalbox.conf|recalbox.conf-(EN)]]**


## <a name='es'></a>III - EmulationStation

### <a name='es-pres'></a>A - Presentation

When you start the recalbox system, the frontend emulationstation shows up.  
You can select your systems, launch your games, or access configuration menu from here.

The first screen is the system screen : 

[![](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/emulationstation-350px.jpg)](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/emulationstation.jpg)

It shows all available systems.


### <a name='es-settings'></a>B - Settings

By pressing start, you will be able to change some system settings.  
[![](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/settings-350px.jpg)](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/blob/master/wiki/images/settings.jpg)

#### <a name='es-settings-sys'></a>1 - SYSTEM SETTINGS
You will access **system information**, **language selection**, **overclock settings**, **updates settings** and **kodi settings**.  
You can change the overclock of your RPI. The overclock speed order for RPI1 is :  
*NONE* < *HIGH* < *TURBO* < *EXTREM*  
Extreme may void your warranty but is **the only one** that will give you really good performance for all emulators on RPi1.

It is also recommended to overclock your RPi2, if you want emulate the N64 and have the best gaming experience.

#### <a name='es-settings-games'></a>2 - GAME SETTINGS
You can set game options : **video ratio** (16/9, 4/3), **image smooth**, **rewind** and **auto save/load**.   
The **rewind** option allows you to turn back time in games.  
:warning: _This feature may slow down some emulators (snes, psx)_ if you enable it by default. You can enable it by emulator in [[recalbox.conf|recalbox.conf-(EN)]]   

The **auto save/load** option allows you to auto save a savestate when you exit a game, then reload automatically this savestate when you restart this game. Once the game started, and the savestate loaded, if you want to return to the title screen of this game, use the [special command](#duringgame-special) **reset**. You can enable it by emulator in [[recalbox.conf|recalbox.conf-(EN)]]   

You can also easily configure *shaders* for your systems. The **shader set** configuration contains the shader sets available for recalbox. The **scanlines** shaders enable scanlines on all systems to look like a CRT television. The **retro** shaders is a set of the best shaders, chosen by the community, that will offer you the closest to original gaming experience !  
More info on [[Shaders configuration|Shaders-configuration-(EN)]] page.  

You can also switch *shaders* in-game using your controller. Use the [Special commands](#duringgame-special) Hotkey + R2 or Hotkey + L2 to see the next or previous shader.
